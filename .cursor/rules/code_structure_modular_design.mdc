# Code Structure and Organization

- Follow the Single Responsibility Principle for modules and functions
- Create reusable components and utility functions
- Organize code in logical packages and modules (e.g., `capture`, `detection`, `visualization`, `utils`)
- Favor composition over inheritance when appropriate
- Create clear interfaces between components
- Use descriptive naming for functions, variables, and modules
- Avoid over-modularization while maintaining clean separation of concerns
- Implement proper file and directory structure for the project
- Design components to be testable and maintainable
