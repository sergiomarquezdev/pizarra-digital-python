# General Python Practices

- Use Python 3.10+ features and syntax
- Follow PEP 8 guidelines with Ruff as the preferred linter/formatter
- Apply strict type hinting with the `typing` module for all functions and methods
- Write clear, concise, and readable code with explicit intent
- Follow the Zen of Python principles in code design
- Use proper exception handling with specific exception types
- Implement logging for important events, warnings, and errors
- Use docstrings in Google style for all functions, methods, and classes
- Prioritize simplicity and maintainability over complex solutions
