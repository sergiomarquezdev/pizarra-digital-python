# Computer Vision with OpenCV and MediaPipe

- Use OpenCV (`cv2`) for image/video processing and camera interactions
- Implement MediaPipe Hands for hand detection and landmark tracking
- Convert between BGR (OpenCV) and RGB (MediaPipe) color formats properly
- Document image formats (BGR/RGB) and coordinate systems clearly
- Handle camera resources properly to avoid memory leaks
- Implement frame preprocessing to optimize detection performance
- Add clear visualization for hand landmarks and connections
- Document MediaPipe version in use
- Implement proper error handling for camera failures and detection issues
- Optimize frame processing for real-time performance
