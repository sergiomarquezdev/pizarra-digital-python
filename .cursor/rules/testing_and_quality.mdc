# Testing and Quality Assurance

- Use `pytest` for all test implementation
- Aim for 90%+ test coverage
- Test common cases, edge cases, and error conditions
- Use fixtures and parametrization for efficient testing
- Include testing for camera unavailability and empty frames
- Test hand detection with various poses and conditions
- Implement proper assertions and error messages
- Create test utilities for common testing operations
- Document test cases with clear docstrings
- Use test doubles (mocks/stubs) for external dependencies like cameras
