# Machine Learning and AI Guidelines

- Keep configuration simple using direct code settings or simple config files
- Maintain simple data pipelines for real-time processing
- Document MediaPipe model versions in use
- Implement comprehensive logging for experiment tracking
- Use appropriate data structures for tracking hand states over time (e.g., `deque`)
- Implement clean interfaces for landmark data processing
- Add proper documentation for coordinate systems and data formats
- Track and log relevant metrics (e.g., FPS, detection counts)
- Consider techniques for smoothing landmark positions over time
- Implement gesture recognition based on landmark sequences if needed
